NAME
    VCS::Hms - notes for the HMS implementation

IMPORTANT NOTE
    I have no way to test this module and so I have removed it out of the
    main VCS distribution. If you have access to Hms and would like to
    maintain this module please contact me - greg@mccarroll.org.uk.

SYNOPSIS
        use VCS;
        $file = VCS::File->new('Makefile');

DESCRIPTION
    Currently, the user needs to ensure that their environment has the HMS
    toolset available, including fhist, fdiff, fco, et al. On Unix like
    environments ensure that the $PATH environment variable has the
    appropriate directory listed.
